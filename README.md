# health-insurance-claim-prediction
This project aims to predict health insurance claim outcomes using top machine learning models. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation, and performance comparison across various classifiers like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
# Health Insurance Claim Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting whether a health insurance claim will be approved or not using various machine learning models. We evaluate and compare different algorithms to determine the most effective approach based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset `Insurance.csv` includes various features relevant to health insurance customers, such as:

- `age`: Age of the insured
- `sex`: Gender
- `bmi`: Body Mass Index
- `children`: Number of children covered by insurance
- `smoker`: Smoking status
- `region`: Geographical region
- `charges`: Insurance premium
- (Possibly other engineered features)

Target variable (in some versions): Whether the claim is approved or not.
